## Abstract
**Keywords: Natural Disasters, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Fujita Scale, Tornado Severity**

As global warming continues to worsen, severe weather events continue to rise in both frequency and magnitude in terms of danger to the surrounding environment and people. In these disasters, the likelihood of death, physical injuries, destruction of property, and loss of financial resources exponentially increases in ocrrelation with their severity and danger. Therefore, it is important that government agencies and disaster relief organizations can have accurate predictions of the severity of these events and where to direct their resources to help people affected by these disasters. **The best metric to assess this disaster: Severity.**

This study analyzes a period of **fifteen** years worth of tornado data from 2007 to 2022 to accurately determine the magnitude/intensity of tornadoes **(Fujita Scale Rating)** after their occurence and determine which features significantly affect the severity of the tornadoes. This project employs a **Random Forest Classification** model that scored 84% accuracy and a **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier** that scored 96% accuracy. Features that most significantly affect the severity of a tornado include size, duration, total damage, and amount of indirect/direct deaths and injuries.
